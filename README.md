## brainstorming

- stories have their own fields, tasks others
- fields: release, external IDs (with links), technologies involved (react, spryker, sql, elixir...), story points...
- task fields: technologies involved
  - collection/tags
  - each tech is in a color
  - bar with colors like github
- task type: analysis, coding, database data, meeting, demo...
- calendar tasks: meeting, company event, holidays, day off, sick, doctor appointment, external event...
- calendar with rooms booking
- a task could be assigned to many people
- kind of asignments: worker, reviewer, tester...
- daily meeting: calendar with all the tasks (daily meeting included)
- where the tasks belong: stories, calendar
- where the stories belong: sprints
- board view:
  - left: stories and tasks
  - right: day calendar (tasks are added to the day until complete it)
- task statuses: new, wip, done, rejected, closed
- story statuses: all tasks new = new, some tasks wip = wip, all tasks done = done
